## Documentation Workflow

This project follows a structured documentation workflow to ensure proper planning and tracking:

### Workflow Process
1. **requirements.md** → Define user stories, acceptance criteria, and functional requirements
2. **design.md** → Translate requirements into technical design, architecture, and implementation details  
3. **tasks.md** → Break down design into actionable development tasks with status tracking

### File Organization
- All documentation is maintained in the `/documentation` folder
- Each phase builds upon the previous one, creating a clear progression from concept to implementation
- Task completion status is tracked in tasks.md to monitor project progress

### Best Practices
- Requirements should be written from user perspective with clear acceptance criteria
- Design should focus on technical architecture and component specifications
- Tasks should be granular, measurable, and include completion status

This workflow ensures thorough planning before implementation and provides clear visibility into project progress.
