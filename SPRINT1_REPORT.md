  - Main security overview page with comprehensive dashboard
  - Cloud provider security status overview
  - Compliance frameworks tracking
  - Security trends and vulnerability distribution
  - Recent security findings display
  - Quick actions for security management

### **3. Missing Security Subpages Created**

#### **Azure Security & Compliance** (`/dashboard/security-compliance/azure/`)
- Azure Secure Score monitoring
- Azure services security status (VMs, Storage, App Services, VNets)
- Compliance frameworks (Azure Security Benchmark, CIS, ISO 27001, NIST, PCI DSS)
- Security trends and threat detection
- Recent security alerts from Azure Security Center
- Security recommendations with impact assessment

#### **GCP Security & Compliance** (`/dashboard/security-compliance/gcp/`)
- GCP Security Command Center integration
